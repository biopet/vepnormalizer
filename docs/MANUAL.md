# Manual

## Introduction
This tool modifies a VCF file annotated with the Variant Effect Predictor (VEP). Since the VEP does not use INFO fields
to annotate, but rather puts all its annotations in one big string inside a "CSQ" INFO tag it is necessary to normalize
it.

The tool will parse the information in the CSQ header to create INFO fields for each annotation field. The tool has two
modes: `standard` and `explode`.

The `standard` mode will produce a VCF according to the VCF specification. This means that every VEP INFO tag will
consist of the comma-separated list of values for each transcript. In case the value is empty, the VEP INFO tag will
not be shown for that specific record.

Mode `explode` will, on the other hand, create a new VCF record for each transcript it encounters. This, thus, means
each VEP INFO tag will consist of a single value (if present at all). This can be useful if one must work on a
per-transcript basis. Please note, however, that this means records may seem to be "duplicated".

The CSQ tag is by default removed from the output VCF file. If one wishes to retain it, one can set the
`--do-not-remove` option.

## Example
To run this tool:
```bash
java -jar VepNormalizer-version.jar -I input.vcf -O output.vcf -m standard
```

To get help:
```bash
java -jar VepNormalizer-version.jar --help
